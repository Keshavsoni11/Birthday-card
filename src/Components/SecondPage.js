          <p>Happiest birthday Kasiss 🎉</p>
          <p>
            I wish you the happiest birthdayyy babyyyyyyy. May God bless you.
            May all your dreams come true.
          </p>

          <p>Do you know:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How much I admire you?</li>
            <li>How much I respect you?</li>
            <li>How much I...?</li>
            <li>How much I...?</li>
            <li>How much I...?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The answer to all these questions is —{" "}
            <strong>I do more than you can think or imagine.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            I know how it all started and how it's going. Things got
            problematic, serious, more and more complex —{" "}
            <strong>but you fought through everything</strong>. And you gave me
            strength for the same.
          </p>

          <p>
            I know how stupid I am, how many times I ignored you, didn’t talk
            properly — but Kasiss,{" "}
            <strong>I never meant any of that</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I can write more and more about you, about us... but that's not the
            point. You already know everything. I just want to give you the best
            wishes every second. I pray for you always.
          </p>

          <p>
            There’s a lot to say. I’ve never met a human being like you —{" "}
            <strong>the purest, the strongest, the smartest</strong>, the one
            who listens to me — every time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thank you Kasiss — for everything: our friendship, our walks, our
            problems, our rhythm, our journey.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don’t promise anything after my existence, but as long as I’m
            alive — I’ll always be your friend: good, bad, best — whatever.
          </p>

          <p>
            No matter how much I write here — a lot will always stay unsaid...
            because you mean more than a book can hold.
          </p>

          <p className="ending">
            Once again —{" "}
            <strong>Happiest birthday Kasisssssssssssss 🎂🎁</strong> <br />
            May all your dreams come true. My wishes are always with you. ❤️
